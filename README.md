# GNU Taler test setup

This is a readily `docker`-ified Taler test setup. Note that some shortcuts were taken to keep this
simple, especially in terms of security. (Works work `podman-compose`, too.)

[Exchange and Bank Setup](README.exchange.md) if you want to host the payment infrastructure for an event.

[Merchant Setup](README.merchant.md) if you are want to receive payments, e.g. to sell bottled caffeine or pixels in your LED strip.
